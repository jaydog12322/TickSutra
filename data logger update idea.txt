okay - so I ran did the logging for however long the data says for one stock only. Can you do the count for me 
ChatGPT said:

I loaded your file:

Rows: 760

Columns: 13

Symbol: only one stock (5930 / 005930)

Venues: both KRX and NXT appear

So you‚Äôve got 760 logged ticks in total for that stock across both venues.

üëâ Do you also want me to break it down (e.g., how many rows are from KRX vs NXT, or how many unique timestamps)? 

You said:
how many is that per second - and what was the highest count for the second 
ChatGPT said:

Here‚Äôs the breakdown from your log:

Average rate: ~2.36 messages per second

Highest activity: 16 messages in a single second

That peak second: 2025-09-08 16:12:04

Would you like me to also chart the per-second activity over time so you can see the bursts visually? 

You said:
since this is an aftermarket logging - I would assume that during the morning, the count would be at least 3 times more. Assuming that, if we did the for 710 stocks, what's the number look like for us
ChatGPT said:

Using your assumption (morning traffic ‚âà 3√ó the aftermarket):

Per stock (morning estimate):

Average ‚âà 7.08 messages/sec

Peak ‚âà 48 messages/sec

Scaled to 710 stocks:

Average ‚âà ~5,027 messages/sec

Peak ‚âà ~34,080 messages/sec

‚ö° That‚Äôs the ballpark ingestion load you‚Äôd be facing if you logged all 710 symbols during the morning session.

Do you want me to also translate that into approximate data throughput (rows/minute, rows/hour) so you can assess storage/logging needs?

I'm planning use this data logger to log for all 710 stocks. The data logger does this buffer system where it buffers up to 5000 and then flush it down to disk memory. In light of the count analysis we have above - can our data logger handle 710 stocks all at once?

Thought for 32s

Short answer: not reliably, as-is.

Here‚Äôs why, using your measured rate and your code‚Äôs current design:

Measured aftermarket avg: ~2.36 msg/s per stock ‚Üí you assumed √ó3 for morning ‚áí ~7.08 msg/s per stock.

710 stocks ‚áí avg ingest: ~5,027 msg/s.

Peak second (√ó3): ~48 msg/s per stock ‚áí ~34,080 msg/s across 710.

Your buffer is 5,000 and you flush synchronously when it fills (and every 30s). At the average morning load, the buffer fills in ~0.99 s; at the peak, it fills in ~0.15 s. Each flush runs an external process (parquet_tool.exe) on the GUI thread and blocks the event loop while it writes. That means during busy bursts you‚Äôd be trying to launch/await the external writer many times per second, stalling the GUI and risking data loss (events can‚Äôt be processed while blocked).

What to change (minimal, practical fixes)

Move writes off the GUI thread.

Put _write_buffer() behind a producer‚Äìconsumer queue and flush using a dedicated QThread (or Python thread) writer. GUI thread only pushes full chunks into the queue.

Double-buffer the ingest.

On threshold, swap the live buffer with an empty one in O(1) and hand the full chunk to the writer thread. No blocking in add_record().

Raise the flush threshold substantially.

Use size ‚â• 100,000 or time ‚â• 1‚Äì2 s, whichever comes first.

At 5k msg/s avg, 100k = ~20 s of data per flush; at a 34k peak you‚Äôll still flush every ~3 s‚Äîbut asynchronously.

Reduce external-process overhead.

If possible, switch to in-process pyarrow on 64-bit (your earlier build work suggests you‚Äôre headed there). External process per flush is costly.

If you must keep the tool, allow the writer thread to reuse a persistent process (if the tool supports it) or batch multiple chunks before invoking it once.

Write to fast staging then convert.

As a fallback, writer thread can append newline-delimited JSON or CSV to a rolling file (very fast), and a separate task converts/compacts to Parquet every N seconds/minutes.

Add backpressure + metrics.

Track queue length and drop to a lighter schema (or sample) if the writer can‚Äôt keep up; log warnings when ‚Äúseconds-of-buffered-data‚Äù exceeds, say, 5‚Äì10 s.

Quick capacity sanity checks

Average 5,027 msg/s: a 100k chunk every ~20 s feels reasonable for one writer thread on SSD/NVMe if using pyarrow.

Peak 34,080 msg/s: a 100k chunk every ~2.9 s; still okay if the writer is off the main thread and uses columnar/binary writes. Disk bandwidth (a few‚Äì10+ MB/s) is fine; the bottleneck is synchronous process launches and main-thread blocking‚Äînot raw I/O.

Concrete code nudge (where to change)

Your current _write_buffer() uses subprocess.run(...) directly from add_record() threshold path and from the 30s timer, on the GUI thread. Refactor so:

add_record() only appends; when threshold hit, it moves self.buffer into a local var, replaces with a fresh list, and queues that full list to a writer thread.

The writer thread does JSON temp file + parquet write, then emits file_written(...) back to the GUI.
This removes the event-loop stalls that will otherwise clobber you at 710 symbols.

If you want, I can rewrite the DataBuffer into a double-buffer + background writer thread (drop-in replacement) and show the exact diffs.
